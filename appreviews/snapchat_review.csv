0,A K,"Overall, good app - fun to use. Until the latest update, my Snapchat had been working well. Suddenly, I can't look at messages sent to me, can't update my story and can't send messages. I'm so frustrated with this update. I came to the play store to see if I could get another update to fix the issues or return to a previous version. No dice. Also, very tired of having to hide, then rehide things in discovery that I'm not interested in and I'm told will not appear in my suggestions again.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"10,311 people found this review helpful","March 12, 2023"
1,The Bean Overlord,"i think its a great app, but theres a lot that could be fixed. it almost feels like its not meant for android considering how many things are lacking. for example dark mode and the way some of the filters load. also, the filters at the bottom after you take the picture gets in the way more times than not when editing. also, if you try and sign in to your account on another device you HAVE to sign out on the other because if you dont youll have to delete and redownload the app",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,552 people found this review helpful,"March 29, 2023"
2,uh oh,"Calls cannot stay stable, frequently loosing connection and causing breaks in the conversation. You cannot turn off the notification for if someone is typing, so if someone wants to send a message or two your phone will not shut up. Stories run strait into advertisements at full volume. The only reason I have or use it is because my friends use it. Changing the lame default notification sound is difficult.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,8 people found this review helpful,"March 29, 2023"
3,Emaurice Flat Lip,"Whenever I am trying to search for a specific date in memories, only a few memories show up and aren't even the date I'm looking for. Also still no dark mode for Android. I have been waiting for nearly 3 years now for Snapchat to include dark mode for Android. The filters on the bottom of the screen make it hard to edit your texts and get in the way. Another thing is a story issue, as I watch someone's story and then it pops up again, although I have already watched it.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"4,571 people found this review helpful","March 8, 2023"

I have 40% battery right now, and everything else works fine. It's not the first time this has happened. I'd like you to look into why that is. This phone does have a weak battery, but it's consistently with your app that it crashes before the battery reaches critical levels as opposed to others.

So I like how there's a lot of options but I really feel like there should be more curly updo styles, cause I have really curly hair but most of the updos are for straight hair. And also maybe you could add darker shades of some of the eyeshadow colors?

7,The A5ylum,For some reason when I call it won't allow me to switch from the phone speaker to speaker phone. I have contacted Snapchat support they told me they were looking into it then I heard nothing else from them. It has really become extremely irritating can't really use the video call function because I can't hear anything.

Cannot be removed as an option, cannot control ones own experience, can use the Snapchat API to change it either. Like.

My biggest gripe is that the 3D bitmojis are so disgustingly ugly. I hate looking at them. The 2D ones were fine, the 3D looks cheap, gross and bad.

11,Austin Barker,"Snapchat is my number one app in terms of usage. It's my primary communication route of roughly seven years. However, there are many issues to be addressed. Snapchat has been consuming almost 2 gigabytes of memory everytime I launch it. I optimize my memory and open it back, but I then am faced with another memory usage spike and am hindered in my abilities: opening snaps, chats, stories, etc. There's up to a 15 second processing time for each input that Snap communicates.

12,Heather FX,The constant 'enable quick tap to start' pop up every single time I open the app is ridiculously annoying. I keep waiting for an update to give the option to stop asking but the only options continue to be to enable it or maybe later. I tried enabling it just to get rid of the message but it activated too much or not enough. At this point the message is annoying enough that I'm highly considering uninstalling.

However, I do not like the new feature where there is a text box or a ""view profile"" button at the bottom of the screen while watching stories. This text box overlaps the subtitles, sometimes covers important images, and as far as I can tell, there's no way to get rid of it.

And now everytime I add text, it automatically goes to the very bottom of the screen, so I can't edit it or move it because it opens up the filters. It has also begun to crash 70% of the time I try to send a video or photo.

However, I've had an issue of not being able to edit pictures with the little row of filters, not at but near the bottom. You would go to click to edit that text and couldn't because the filters would pop up instead. It seems to remedy this issue. Now, the text won't go lower than the little filter row, and it makes for awkward placement of text on the picture.

However, once the filter activates, it doesn't let me slide anywhere else. I can't go back, nor can i switch to a different filter via swiping. Not only that, but it completely freezes the UI for the video. I can't save it, nor can I post it on any stories or send it to friends. This ruins your main feature, which is video sending.

There's a new screen it brings you to when you want to add a clip to another clip you've already made. I'm on that screen and I'm trying to get a certain filter on because I need that one. Whenever I try to get the filter it doesn't load I've been here for 10 minutes waiting for it.

714,Kirsty Loker,Hi there I lobe using snapchat for talking to my friends and taking pictures. The thing that's annoying me jn the way the flash is on android. On iPhone you can switch it to ring or regular but android you can't and I prefer the old style flash.

If anything, you can probably expand to the adult world by making the delete chats never feature (instead of immediately or 24 hrs). Snap already has every person my age hooked.

Lots of bots and random accounts trying to contact you plague the app making it bad for kids or younger people to use.

1777,Shea Boland,Gotten worse over time. The ads are incredibly annoying and much more frequent than any other social platform. Snap is also the only social app that forces you to watch an ad in order to continue watching the content you want. I'd much rather have a 30 second ad at the beginning of some content I want to watch rather than 8 5 second unskippable ads that break it up.

Bitmojis needs to be more customisable with more unique branded items especially the Adidas shirts. I don't see any light green for background colours.

Most apps or games would have this kind of option in an update, so this is incredibly disappointing, as it is obvious and annoying to people who like to dress up their bitmojis.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"January 5, 2023"

The app also lacks an option to change the default page from the camera to chats. These basic features that would take about one day to implement continue to be neglected. The camera quality is also substantially worse compared to my phone's camera app. Snapchat+ is a scam because it doesn't solve the basic issues with the app.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"2,541 people found this review helpful","December 20, 2022"

I would think you had cross platform app so everyone has the same features at the same time - but I guess not,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"March 12, 2019"

I never use the map - The app often freezes or crashes, or I can't open the camera roll, or if I can, I can not share or edit a photo.

But mine just updated (not sure if it was only updated on androids) and the front flash has totally changed for the worse. It needs to go back to the original flash, the screen doesn't even flash anymore it is just a white border around the screen to make it ""brighter"" but quite honestly barely does anything.

If you have a slow phone, it doesn't send snaps and messages so check before you install.

You can see the normal focused quality before taking it and then it changes to a blurred version straight after. The app is very glitchy and bad quality. Not liking Snapchat on Android so far...

7668,Jordan Aikorns,Yo. So I have a 22 Ultra and this thing can't even run correctly. Three questions. 1: Why can't you keep the camera and mic from randomly turning on and off. EVEN WHEN THE APP IS CLOSED. Only app on my phone that does this. (I've tested) 2: Why can't we see chat messages and reply from notifications? Like ANY OTHER APP? fr. 3: Why can't you just allow me to pick a second phone (which you should be able to enable in settings) so I don't have to sign in and out all the time? But keep trying.üëç,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,122 people found this review helpful,"March 6, 2023"

I have uninstalled and reinstalled with no change. I only have this issue with Snapchat. The quality of my photos are also poor. Instagram Stories are 100x better; please fix these issues. Also, I came from iPhone and have noticed that the iOS version and the Android version are different.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,7 people found this review helpful,"September 7, 2019"
7837,Ali Asumani,The app is good it's fine but like why do you lock my account. Two times two times my account has been locked cuz I violated community guidelines that you don't wanna state. Shouldn't I know what I did and how exactly I did it cuz I'm shocked. I just woke up and they're like you violated something and my old account is still locked so like Snapchat what's going on like what's happening.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,24 people found this review helpful,"January 28, 2023"

7840,A Google user,"The updates recently had made Sc becoming worse and worse - that it used to be one of my fav apps and yet it sucks causing me to not consider it as my first choice anymore. I find it difficult to edit snaps that I saved in sc, and it even so hard for me to scroll through my album(as it easily slides to another page etc) Im so fed up with that!! There are too many updated settings that users as for me are unable to cope with.

7845,Makuen Chilton,"Honestly, every time I use this app or change phones this app gets worse. How is it that the app is more stable, but still not completely stable on an S8, of which is running Android 8 and is over 3 years old, but a S20+ on the latest version of android is unstable? Keyboard covering typing spaces, random crashes, notifications don't update etc. Your lucky that everyone has been using this app for a while, because with an app that runs as poorly as this, you definetly wouldn't attract anyone new",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2 people found this review helpful,"July 10, 2021"
7846,A Google user,"App is getting worse and worse by the update. I have a galaxy s7 edge and I can no longer post videos that are a minute long. Can no longer take videos that are longer than 10 seconds. The filters which once appeared after a pic or video had been taken have gone. I have to save all videos and pics I take because it may not post when I try to post it immediately having taken it. App moves slow. Picture quality is garbage and then I come on here to leave a comment and realise I'm not the only one who feels like this. So why isn't it being fixed? I keep updating, frequently, with the hope issues will be fixed but it's just getting worse. Snapchat is becoming pathetic. You're leaving a huge gap in the market and at this rate, I hope someone takes full advantage. Let's all take the time to remember... Hi5.

The app comes with a user-friendly background that is yellowish and supports adding friends via QR Code. Also, the app is for teenagers to use and unlike other Social Media apps, this one is very addictive and may require a type of control.

Also doesn't allow you to save other users sticker designs but before the update it did. Can't upload directly from your camera roll to My Eyes Only, you have to do one at a time to Memories then one at a time to My Eyes Only.
