0,Micah Curry,"It's fun, for me it's worth it. It doesn't get nearly as many updates as the IOS version which is super annoying, so there's features that they can do but I just cant. I also had trouble leaving the app just now. I just couldn't get away from it. I had to change my volume, and click more options so my phone would take me to sound settings. Uncommon problem. Lowered to two stars cause of how much they neglect Android. pretty darn annoying. edit again, app basically has cobwebs. android hate smh",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"March 25, 2023"
1,Saraiah Jeanjacques,"This is a good app to stay connected to friends, but it is definitely biased. I don't have an Iphone, and there is a lot of things that my friends can do that I can't. It's a waste of time to send a message on thus app, but then I have to remind them that I can't see it because yall dont want to give samsung users the same updates.

2,Kyra B. (Lucy Brucy),"So basically it's a great app and stuff but it's obviously meant for iOS products, not Samsung. The only reason I'm giving this app a one-star review is bc it doesn't sync up the features provided with iOS. For instance, you can message/ contact people through the app on iOS but on my phone, it doesn't let me. It'll give me the notification that someone responded but I can't see what they said. So it's getting annoying at this point. Please fix it.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"March 15, 2023"

6,Vincent Heinzmann,"Great app in a lot of ways, although it needs to stop catering only to iOS. As someone who switched from an iPhone, I realized Android Locket is missing features such as the entire messaging system they have on there, so instead of my friends sending me an in app message, they have to send me an SMS message instead. Like I said, it's a great app, but until this company stops only updating the iOS version, I have to give it two stars.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"March 10, 2023"
7,Kayla Allison,Great idea! But needs improvement. I love being able to see photos of friends without the millions of ads. But we need the same features as ios. Friends will comment on my photos and I can't see them because the messaging feature is unavailable for Android. Fix that and this ap will get 5 stars.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"February 21, 2023"
8,Vanaah,"The app is fantastic and an adorable means of communicating with friends. However, it takes an embarrassingly long time to update the Android app. The reply feature in app has been available to ios since early December. Android to iPhone photos look crunchy for no reason. We don't have the rewind feature, separate widgets, or even the ability to zoom in on photos. This app on android is so neglected and poorly optimized as well. I hope this changes soon.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"January 11, 2023"
9,Donovan Sheets,"This app has great potential, it's working with a fantastic idea. Unfortunately it's really not there yet as far as technical development. Issue 1: it is very buggy still. Camera being cut off, crashes, etc. Issue 2: very feature light. The android widget is not resizable and very space inefficient. You can't upload photos taken to it. No way to configure the flash options (screen brightness or white flash for selfie). Fix these and it's an easy 5 star.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"December 1, 2022"
10,Izzy DeLeon,"I feel like Android users are neglected. My friends have apple and they can do all different things than I can. First it was the adding a description to your post. My friend had it for about 2 months before I could. And now it's commenting on post my friends have has it for a bit(idk how long) and I can't see them nor comment. Please try and resolve these issues. It's very annoying and lowers have a good experience with the app. Other than that,.it's a pretty decent app. I would love to see more",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"January 13, 2023"
11,kaiden ritchie,i love locket! its a perfect way to keep up with your friends and share cute moments! i have no complaints other than its a little slow at times but that could also just be my internet connection. also i wish you could have more than 20 friends. at least 25 but it'd be better if there was no limit. another thing that i would like to add is a gallery option. this would be AMAZING! this app is so cute and creative. me and my friends love it!,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"November 7, 2022"
12,Victoria Brownlee,"its cool but there could be more to like being able too change the color of the text and move it too any designated spot, being able too see who did the sender send the locket too like if it was sent to all it would be nice too see if they did, and a 3 & 10 second count down on the camera would be nice, and an option to select pics from your camera. hope my request comes true would give 5 stars for it :)",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"December 12, 2022"
13,Thomas Shober,Just fun! It's nice to have such a simple social media app. it still feels a little young and could use more polish but I really love it. I've delt with small bugs that normally get fixed when you restart the app. I wish it would default to the last person you sent to rather than ALL. it'd also be nice to scroll within the widget through the photo history.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"October 12, 2022"
14,Particle,"App works initially, but it gets slow and spotty eventually. Reinstalling didn't fix it, restarted my phone, reset my connections, no luck. Generally unreliable app. Also, the Android version doesn't let you have multiple locket widgets for different people on your home screen, which was very disappointing. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"January 16, 2023"
15,Nadia,"Locket is a great, fun, and creative app! Keeps you in touch with your friends without even having to say much! I'd suggest adding a feature to upload photos from your gallery to locket for higher quality photos as the in app camera isn't very good quality when it comes to certain android phones. Great app though and i can see so many more possibilities for it in the future!",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"October 15, 2022"
16,SingYu Lam,"This has been a really fun app for me to use, however there are still a few things I'd like to see. Zooming in and reactions would be appreciated, but also more resizing options on the home screen. On my Pixel 5 I am unable to change the vertical height past a certain point, causing the widget to take up a lot of unnecessary space. Also, on iOS I was also able to export a video with all the lockets I have ever exchanged, but that feature doesn't seem to be available on Android yet.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"August 5, 2022"
17,Stylish Sylvie,"Great app, super fun! I love that we get to keep all the memories :) however, I think it'd be cool if you can have a widget for seperate friends because you can currently only have one widget up unless you want multiple of the same widget. Maybe you should make it to where you can have a widget for each friend, so like that friend's most recent photo. Also it would be cool if we could sent it to specific friends and have more than 10 friends. Thank you for your consideration, keep it up! :)",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"April 22, 2022"
18,Camilleon241,"I feel like there are alot of improvements that you can make to the android version of this app, and I'll start from most needed to least needed. 1, better camera. The one now looks odd. 2, zooming in. I have no idea why zooming in isn't an option for the android version, it'd be very useful. 3, being able to send and receive reactions. I just found out the IOS version had reactions, and I've had this app for about 3 months now. These improvements can really make the Android version great.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"June 4, 2022"
19,Natalie Ray,"I love it but you can only have up to 10 friends, this wouldn't be a problem except the app won't let me have more than 5 while saying the max is 10 everytime I try to add new people. it also has a hard time registering who your friends are in the app when you first open it. you have to take 7+ pictures before it registers you have friends in the app. I do enjoy the recent update where you can send certain pictures to singular friends instead of all of them.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"May 26, 2022"
20,velsora,"It's a really cute app, I love it ‚Äî except for the fact that when you have bad reception and it's loading to send a picture, you can't do anything ‚Äî no retakes or cancelling ‚Äî but to wait.... and sometimes it takes so long to send that it ends up not sending it at all :( so many fleeting moments lost and not sent entirelyü•π So yeah, make sure you have good internet connection when you want to send anything ever, or else just send a snap, I guess",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"October 11, 2022"
21,Jordyn Taylor,"App is decent overall. I had a little trouble with it saying verification code is incorrect but it was a quick fix with just restarting the app and letting it automatically input it when the text was sent. My only complaint is that it doesn't have the option to send photos from your gallery or edit photos taken. Otherwise, I enjoy using the app to send pictures to my friends.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"April 22, 2022"
22,Baby Bans,"I love this app and definitely recommend it for relationships that are long distance. I do have to agree with a former review saying that we should be able to have multiple widgets with different photos/people, as that would literally make this the best app on my phone (I'm dead serious). But other than that no complaints.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"September 14, 2022"
23,Montanna,"Love this idea, it's so cute! Wish you could have multiple widgets on your home screen for different friends, though. I saw a screenshot demonstrating this, but it doesn't seem to work for me. I have two widgets on the home screen but both are showing the same photo. It would be nice to choose which friend is displayed in which widget. [EDIT: I really appreciate how quickly the developer team responded to this request! I'm looking forward to seeing how this app grows & happy to support you guys]",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"August 8, 2022"
24,Cari Fisher,"I like it, but needs some work. For example, you should be able to add multiple widgets that show different photos. Right now two widgets just show the same pic. Also, the pics should have settings such as rotate or show newest only, so if you're missing photos you can change the setting. Maybe some way to see the reactions, and the main screen for the app shouldn't be the camera. The camera app needs lots of settings to compete. And different shaped widgets please!",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"September 8, 2022"
25,Mike,"This app is awesome! For people like me, it makes me feel better and let's me know that my friends are still alive. Though I do really wish that you could upload pictures from your camera roll. That's probably my only complaint, because you cant send a cringy picture from when someone was little to embarrass anyone, and you cant send screenshots or anything. Other than that the app is amazing and I highly recommend, especially for people with anxiety!!",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"May 23, 2022"
26,allison,"I dont really understand the low reviews. I've been waiting for the apps release on Android and I'm not disappointed. Although there are minor bugs, it's not anything too noticeable that it becomes annoying. I've been enjoying using it so far. Some suggestions for future additions, I would like to have the reaction feature added to android as well. I can receive reactions but I can't give them back.

27,Pann,"This is a great app to have fun with your friends. But please look after and give more love to the Android version, my ios friends can send messages to each other but i can't, also iPhone can take sharper and more resolution photos than my Samsung note 20U. Also, there are some bugs in the app, for example, I can't scroll down to the end of my emoji reactions list, and it keeps bringing me back to the top.

28,allyson gray,"It's a cute little app and it does its job okay, but the Android version is so limited compared to the iPhone version! It was really confusing because my friend on iPhone kept sending me ""replies"", but on my end I couldn't see them or respond in any way. I'd love to see a more complete Android version (I wouldn't even mind some kind of monetization feature to support development) - or at the very least a warning about the incompatibility of the different versions!",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"March 2, 2023"
29,Shirley Lin,"Android version is actually terrible compared to iOS. My friends have been sending me text replies which i get the notifications for but am unable to see or respond to in any way. It also gets very laggy and sometimes glitches where I can see photos that others send but cannot send any back as when I take a picture the photo turns black and the screen freezes. I have had to delete and redownload a few times to fix it. Android still doesn't have the individual widgets option, which is unfair.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"March 6, 2023"
30,Pradipa,"This is nice for sharing memories with best friends. But the android version is soooooooo baddddd, how come you can reply in ios but not in android?? I don't want to reply my friends with SMS, and i occasionally get graphic issue whenever i wanna see my locket, while it is easily fixes by force closing, it IS annoyingly frequent.

31,Jean Angulo (Jean Bean),"Great but I wish u could do more then just send people pics and add widgets to your home screen and it would be cool if you could use pics from your gallery.

32,James Kolea,"The app is great and cool! A few problems, the word count on the pictures is super short so I really can't type much at all, and as an andriod user I can't have the option to have certain people widgets so maybe that can be fixed and it glitches and the widget disappears sometimes.

43,Elizabeth Owles,Love the concept. It would be nice if there was a timer on the app so I can take photos from a distance. My boyfriend and I are long distance and love this app. Personally I don't really want filters or to upload photos because I think it takes away from the sentiment. I just would like the ability to use my Camera fully (timer or palm recognition for the Samsungs) etc,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"January 12, 2023"

50,Benjamin Micheli,Overall great performance great for me and my friends. However I have a few thing that would make it just that bit better: 1. Streaks - Everyday you should send 1 photo at least to each other to keep a streak. 2. I'd really like to be able to have a different widget for different people instead of one widget for all. 3.

Users still cannot communicate within the application with each other when ios users can chat between themselves.
