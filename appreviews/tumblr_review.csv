0,Roman W,"While I love Tumblr as a platform, their app is go glitchy 😭 it crashes and freezes often. They layout is weird, and it's a bit hard to use, especially for asks. Also I don't like Tumblr live and wish I could turn it off permanently instead of just for a week. On top of that they send me WAY too many messages! I turned off messages in the app and it didn't seem to work, so then I turned them off in settings but now they keep asking for me to turn system notifications back on 😭😭",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,267 people found this review helpful,"March 12, 2023"
1,Akiizayoi4869,"I love the app, but I just have one issue with it. On the android version of it, every once and a while my activity feed will be blank. I just keep getting an error message that says ""we could not complete your request at this time"". This never happens when I use the IOS version of the app. And also, I don't know which update it was, but ever since then it has made images in text posts way too small. And please bring back the option to block someone who already has you blocked.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,42 people found this review helpful,"March 26, 2023"
2,Chrissie Bethune,"The app doesn't work very well for me, it freezes and lags a lot, when I agree to the update prompts, nothing seems to happen. But still - it's tumblr! Of all the ""social"" sites I use, this one has the largest ratio of things that make me happy as opposed to things that make me sigh in exasperation. I should add that that I have seen disturbing ads with jeffry dhomar body horror gore stuff before and I still prefer browsing on my computer for things like this.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,132 people found this review helpful,"March 8, 2023"
3,Molly Brown,"Crashes about once every 2 minutes for what seems to be a variety of reasons. New update made images in text posts very very small, too small to see without making the images full-sized. You might think oh, not a problem, you can just click on the picture to make it full-sized! Nope. That crashes the app. Scrolling through posts crashes the app. Loading new posts crashes the app. Breathing near the app crashes the app.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,288 people found this review helpful,"January 19, 2023"
4,Jester,"The recent updates aside from polls have made this app practically unusable for me. With the new updates to the image viewer/video player you cannot zoom in on pictures or pause or rewind videos, which sucks. Additionally, the profile tab at the bottom of the screen has been swapped out for the store tab, meaning I can't easily access my profile while saving my place on the dashboard. On top of that, I hate having to snooze tumblr live every week when nobody uses it. Accessibility is tanking.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,166 people found this review helpful,"February 9, 2023"
5,Riley Lord,"The new updates are terrible. The Live function is useless and can only be snoozed for a week (although it definitely comes back sooner than that). Now I click on a hard-to-read photo intending to zoom in and it won't. I swipe up to continue scrolling through the post and the rest of my dash, but instead I'm shown more random and endless posts. This is absolutely ridiculous.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,74 people found this review helpful,"February 8, 2023"
6,b r,"2-2-23 unremovable NEW notification on Live feature. I'd like to have the option to go through pages instead of endless scroll that refreshes poorly and I lose my place, at least if I know I'm on page 40/50 I'll have some vague idea of where I left off. I'd also like to see the archive of each blog, something that's easy to find on desktop.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,175 people found this review helpful,"February 3, 2023"
7,Ben Rhea,"Since the completely unwanted ""tumblr tv"" update, the app has been aggravating to no end, bordering on unusable. You can no longer swipe up to back out of an expanded image/video, instead you're shown another completely random pic from someone you don't follow. And forget about being able to scrub through videos, zoom in on photos, or even SEE smaller images, because the ALT text box completely covers them up now. Lastly, I don't wanna ""snooze"" tumblr live- I want it off my dash permanently.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,135 people found this review helpful,"February 8, 2023"
8,Bunny Katzen,"They have started making changes to the picture formats that make it hostile to those with disabilities. You have to do multiple steps to be able to zoom in on images. You cannot swipe out of the image to go back to dash; it just shows images from different posts! Also it displays your primary blog instead of the sideblog it was posted from; for people who have separate private & public/business blogs, that's a huge privacy concern! This all is atrocious and unnecessary.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,34 people found this review helpful,"February 8, 2023"
9,nobodyin particular,"This most recent update that changed the video and picture layout sucks. You can't zoom in on pictures anymore and videos don't play on the dashboard right and are cropped weirdly, while starting out muted. Also, I don't want to be able to scroll to other videos or pictures from the post I'm on. That's content from people I don't follow and have zero control over choosing to see. Between that and Tumblr live, I'm not sure I like this app's direction. I understand they need money, but not a fan.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,38 people found this review helpful,"February 8, 2023"
10,Tyler,"It's functional. But the recent photos/videos viewer update just made it more like other social media apps that I don't like nor want to use. Thankfully I turned off automatic updates before the buttons on the bottom of the screen were moved, but that also is a horrible update. I understand you need to make money to run a big website but pushing and promoting the store like this only has the opposite effect with tumblr's obstinante crowd.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,24 people found this review helpful,"February 12, 2023"
11,J R,"There are bugs here and there. Unnecessary changes to UI appearance that literally no one asked for occurs every 6 months instead of fixing said bugs or introducing a new function users actually want.

12,Mystic Kiwi,"I like Tumblr but the app is aweful. It's always crashing. I can't ever scroll through tags because it crashes and takes me to the top of the page, where I've seen all the posts. Does that with my feed too. So I'm just always looking at the most recent posts and can't look at the ones I missed. Crashes way too often.

13,Just Me,"I love using Tumblr, gave it a rave review a while back. But the app went Wonky (your term) a week or so ago. Now it shows me a black screen that keeps saying things like 'Internet Strangeness', 'Something Goofed', 'Minor Hiccup' 'Try Again'. I can see my account Home Page, with the color scheme I created, but it's empty. I can't post, & logging out & back in didn't fix the problem.

I don't know of a single person who doesn't mute those videos! And the way that videos and images are now displayed upon clicking on them is terrible. The bottom of the picture is obscured by post info, and if you swipe up, it takes you to completely unrelated images and videos. Why?

I also don't care at all about the new 'Tumblr Live' feature but it's made 10x more irritating by the fact that i have to manually turn it off EVERY SEVEN DAYS. On top of this the app keeps randomly crashing, it's happening more and more frequently and it makes me want to rip out hairs.

I keep the mobile app to get notifications for direct messages and pings, but otherwise I find myself using it less and less. On desktop, there is less bloat, and I can use browser extensions/settings like Xkit rewritten to get rid of the rest.

When I click on the link to ""your 2022 year in review!"" On another user's post, tumblr will proceed to reload the dashboard (even if I clicked the link on the person's blog) multiple times with a white screen in the middle, extremely fast.

If you're on blogs, you can't look into their archives or find the latest posts unless you turn on their notifications. It's also straining on the eyes and doesn't follow your blog's theme colors. Not so many options to do. I can see the app being used for quick things, but not as a main use. If it's more user friendly, I'd be using it more often.

However, I recently updated the app and no matter what I do in the settings of the app and my phone, Dark mode no longer works.

Have to retrain muscle memory which is like the worst thing in the universe.

The wizard cannot hide the marketing ploys, the inability to view your own account, and the tracking of its users through tumblr live. I have been a longtime user, and this will not draw new users, all this will do is alienate the people who have stuck around after years.

197,PrincessPonies,I prefer tumblr's browser format significantly and absolutely loathe recent updates on both platforms trying to make tumblr more like other social media/formatting browser more like an app. I use tumblr *because* it's less like platforms like Twitter/Tiktok/Insta/etc. The new photo format update (linked to tumblr live) is horrible and tumblr live itself is garbage that no one on the platform wants or interacts with at all.

It is a great site for bloggers and artists to share their work, as well as for fans of various fandoms to find all the latest content.

Old review: The latest update killed dark mode in the app. Every post now has a white background, regardless of what colour palette setting you choose. When I select dark mode, I expect all background colours to be a dark colour... Please revert the colour palette settings to what they were in the previous update.

Tumblr live is entirely for gathering your data and the option to remove it from your dash puts it on 'snooze' for 7 days. The company they're partnered with is banned in Germany.

856,Caitlin Flavell,I like tumblr and find it easier to use and more entertaining than other social media. On the app however my scrolling is severely impaired by the fact that it will not stop sending me back to the top of the screen at random. I'll switch out to another app for 0.2 seconds and when I come back its reset. Sometimes it does it when I take a screenshot which is doubly frustrating.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,2 people found this review helpful,"January 26, 2021"

865,A Google user,"The tumblr app only survived the porn ban on my phone because I was using it to upload photos to my blog without having to transfer to the pc first. And it worked fine originally! You could make a photo post that would display nicely on both browser and app without distorting the art.  This is no longer the case. Now all image posts made by the app are text posts, with the image inserted into the text body. This causes the image to distort any time it's reblogged, as it's warped by the indents applied to the original post any time someone adds commentary. I assume the same thing is happening to video posts, as many of the videos shown on the browser are similarly distorted.  The platform itself was very good, but poor management and bad design decisions are driving it into the ground. The app is clearly no longer suitable for anything but text posts, so I will be uninstalling it and reverting to the browser until one of tumblr's fledgling competitors begins picking up steam.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,113 people found this review helpful,"May 20, 2019"

1103,A Google user,"Tumblr, I've been using you for years and up until now I've never thought I had any reason to complain about this app. But recently you've decided to make a change to the advertising on your app. It's really made it a much less enjoyable experience and to be honest it's put me off using it as much as I used to. I can't enjoy it when I'm scrolling down my dashboard and getting massive ads that take up most of my screen saying 'sponsored: SINGLE WOMEN IN YOUR AREA!' I have to say tumblr staff, it really cheapens the site. They're also very repetitive, with the same ads over and over again. They pop up very often along the dashboard too. Think you've gone too far with the ads this time mate. I honestly didn't mind the old ad system where they were formatted like tumblr posts, so that they weren't as disruptive. And the quality of the ads featured has definitely decreased. I don't know about anyone else's experience, but all of mine feature trashy dating site links. Not something I'd expect from tumblr. Anyway, it'd be great if you reconsidered how you're using advertising on this app. If it stays like this, I think I may consider not using tumblr mobile any more.

2271,A Google user,The issue in mentioned in my previous review mostly doesnt occur anymore and ussually solves itself with time but still happens. Now controversy aside ive been having some serious techincal issues ever since this whole NSFW debacle started around two weeks ago. On certain tumblr pages i cannot view the latest posts. The top post is ussually a random post from the past and contiues backwards chronologically from there. Attempting to refresh the page or view a post that was made after the one at the top just opens the same tumblr page with the old post. Also an issue that has plagued the site in general for more than a year is that the search function is broken on private blogs. This was something i could ignore in the past but ever since tumblr recently started to force blogs into private mode (due to suspected nsfw content) this issue is now more of an issue then ever.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"December 5, 2018"

Because of this, multiple posts have been flagged for no reason; including selfies, artwork/sculptures, sand dunes, etc. And let's not forget that the reason for this was in part due to the amount of fake accounts that posted sensitive material.

Also, I've noticed when you scroll through tags on the app, you don't even see all the posts unless you move to a browser.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,3 people found this review helpful,"November 19, 2019"

One of the issues that started this? Pornbots. which have already found a way to work around the less than subpar algorithm Tumblr has set in place by tagging things as sfw.

3657,A Google user,"Tumblr claims to be a place that encourages you to be yourself, share what you like, bond with others that share your interests. Yet, it's choosing to outright ban NSFW media (excluding written erotica, so not even properly across the board), of which people absolutely use to express themselves. This year, they have made it so 'explicit' pages cannot be viewed without a login, forced the new 'safe mode' as a default to every single user's settings, and removed explicit blogs from showing up in tags altogether. The toggle-able ability to hide mature content was more than enough. Removing this means of expression not only isolates those who once felt safe and comfortable sharing these interests, but it also greatly hurts adult artists and sex workers who were making a living in this interactive community. Yet, no work has been put into clearing the site of all the terrible harassment and hate speech that the ToS also clearly claims to be against. (also, the app is terrible. There are many aspects of it that are all around more accessible on the web version, not to mention users' blogs not showing properly, search functions completely breaking, and all the menus you have to go through just to access your inbox.

4022,A Google user,"Tumblr, both for me and my friends, used to be a space where we can share our art and talk about what we're interested in. I met some of my good friends, my favored artistic inspirations, and much more with this site. But as of now, it has become an even more hollow shell of what it used to be. Not only is it not taking care of its primary issues of rampant child pornography and hate groups, and let useless bots arbitrarily hide posts they suspects to possess inappropriate nudity (i.e.: ""female presenting nipples""), but Tumblr does NOT allow for an appeal for the hidden posts to shown again-the Tumblr bots completely change its targeted posts to be completely inaccessible with no visible option on the edited post to contact the Tumblr staff to change it.   Tumblr is censoring its own users.  So unless you want to take exhaustive shortcuts to evade this application's obsolete bot system, deal with pedophiles and white nationalists alike spewing their individual propagandas, and witness both your own and your friends' most prized art pieces become hidden from the public for good, I suggest NOT to waste your time with this app, today or even in the future.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,2 people found this review helpful,"December 26, 2018"

There are plenty of photographs/images from artists that actually celebrate the human form. These types of works are an important part in helping to promote acceptance of one's body and taboos concerning nudity. I just think it's quite a shame that Tumblr will end up cutting off the good in order to be safe from the ""bad."" It really does take away the artistic freedom of the artist and their voice.

4310,A Google user,"The app is and has always been terrible, but until now I've put up with it because I liked the website. Yahoo bought it a couple years ago, apparently realized that tumblr is basically impossible to market to, and have been sabotaging the website ever since. The most recent development is the ban of ""adult content"", which is stupid on multiple levels. Mostly because it's a website for adults. But also this is literally fixing 0 of the major problems currently plaguing the site, such as literal real life white supremacists, death/doxing threats and other forms of hate mail, hate speech in general really, and a LOT of child porn. The last one they finally addressed when the FBI got involved but not a moment before. The only thing this comes even close to fixing is the porn bots, (which are EVERYWHERE) and that isn't even fixed by this ban since they will just take their content off tumblr but spam the site with links. To make things worse the algorithm they have set up blocks any image with any sort of warm skin tone, instead of just filtering out literal actual porn. It used to be a really cool platform, it felt like the internet used to before your name was attached to everything. It was a platform that allowed people to express themselves creatively and talk about their interests without having to worry about your taste in memes being exposed to the whole world. Too bad Yahoo/tumblr values their advertisers more than their users. Soon they will have neither. If you are looking for new social media to join, look somewhere else.

4334,A Google user,"It was useful at one point, given that it had a decent user base of both wholesome and risque artists. Then, of course, Tumblr decided to encroach on the artists freedom of expression by disallowing NSFW content. Couldn't have any ""female presenting nipples"" on their site, now could they? Unfortunately, Tumblr decided it wanted not just to throw itself of a cliff, but to tumble whilst tazing itself the whole way down: they use an algorithm. Algorithms have this funny quirk of being good in every other context, apart from governing elements of social media. This is because an algorithm has trouble distinguishing between a picture of a sexual act and a picture of Danny DeVito. So everyone is hindered by this change. This platform shouldn't be disregarded in its entirety, however. I am quite find of how, at least on mobile, you can continue scrolling through your timeline for as long as you like.

This most recent change to it's policy regarding adult posts is what will make Tumblr fall apart once and for all. For this reason, I gave the app one star and this review.

4529,A Google user,"Tumblr's newest attempt at making their app family friendly is entirely overdone. They have done away with the ""safe search"" filter option all together, opting instead for complete censorship across it's entire user base.They completely deleted entire tags; including tags that are not directly related to adult content. Many of these being tags that include fashion or aesthetic related content. While I understand and agree with the need for a way to make the app safe for minors and other users who would rather not see adult content, it should be an optional feature rather than an enforced rule (assuming said content is legal). Many small adult content creators rely on Tumblr's platform as a source of income. Because of this change in policy their blogs, content, and, in a way, their livelihoods are being deleted. All of this could be easily fixed if, in addition to the efforts to flag adult content, it was merely rendered optional instead of being completely deleted.

They resort to treating users like children rather than fixing their website, which, considering the app is 17+, is pretty condescending.

5014,A Google user,"Tumblr is an app for people of all kinds with interests of all kinds. We have users of every age, race, gender, political group, sexuality, and any other category of human you could think of. Many of us consider this site a safe haven to express ourselves amongst others that don't know us. Many of us have multiple blogs for focused on different interests. We use each one to interact with others who have similar interests. It's a place unlike facebook, instagram, or twitter where we can truly share our most personal passions without the judgement of others. Tumblr has recently announced that they plan on taking this away from us on Dec.17th. I understand wanting to make this a website for everyone, and I have a suspicion that they only brought this up now because of the increase in sexual spam bots as of late, but that does not give them the right to take away the freedom of half of this sites actual users. Instead of dealing with these bots themselves tumblr staff has created a content sifter that will simply remove any content that seems to have a skintone. So not only is sexual content being removed, any photo with a certain color tone will be removed. We've seen this first hand in what has been flagged as ""explicit content"" so far. A picture of someone's arm has been flagged. A picture of a baby has been flagged. Completely unsexualized art has been flagged. A screencap of thor from the actual marvel movie was flagged. A screencap of mario from the actual mario odyssey game was flagged. A stock photo of a man fully clothed playing video games was flagged. A screencap of Kirby from the actual smash bros game was flagged. A photo of a package of wonder bread was flagged. I don't think I need to go on to prove the point that there is clearly a monumental issue with this system of ""problem solving"". Doing away with half of a site's user base as a solution to too many pornography bots is not a solution at all. The attitude that the tumblr staff has presented us with regarding this problem is not only irresponsible but downright lazy. I'm more than dissapointed in the lack of attentiveness the tumblr staff has has shown towards real issues on this site. This whole sensorship ordeal is not the only issue that this site has been experiencing lately though so I'll move on. As of late none of my links to tumblr posts sent via text have worked. All have failed to open properly for the reciever, who also has the tumblr app. We decided to experiment with sending posts by other means and none were completely successful, not even sending them through tumblr's own messaging system. I enjoy sharing funny or informative posts with my friends like anyone on any social media platform does, so this issue has been particularly annoying for me. There's more than a few other issues that come to mind but they're bugs that have been present in tumblr mobile since the dawn of time, so I don't feel the need to mention them nor do I have hope that they will ever be taken care of. All in all tumblr as a community is fantastic, but those who run it have shown an abysmal amount of care for their user base.

5077,A Google user,"Tumblr is banning adult content after failing miserably to control it. This includes a ton of expressive art, 18+ blogs for humor/fun, and, of course, one of the many reasons people use this app. It helped propagate and proliferate new kinks to all, wonderful bedroom ideas, and gave a meaningful place to find content that wasn't systematically categorized. It made such content feel less degrading and more humanizing through this lack of categorization, and yet still allowed many to browse and share content they enjoyed. It made this content feel less awful to view and, oddly, wholesome in that it presented it in a more human form. It was a wonderful niche for that, and now they are ruining it for everyone because of a failure to better market themselves.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"December 4, 2018"

6328,A Google user,So since the new update for December 17th everything is going to hell. Everything is getting flagged as explicit even stuff that is no where near so. Tumblr is essentially killing itself with stupidity and im tired of it. They manage to Flag there own post as explicit like how do you mess up that badly? I no longer want to use this app do to the blatant stupidity in their decisions. This platform is not judgment free anymore and it damn sure is nowhere near a safe creative space.

Now I am incredibly disappointed with this app's performance and the staff's failure to fix many of its issues and have only made more ridiculous mistakes. Many errors when loading a search in the past would appear and videos would either be unplayable or crash the app. If my android was low on battery and I was watching a video, there was no easy way to close out the video. Many posts don't get viewed and the ""most recent"" and ""top"" wouldn't work sometimes. The gif tag never worked when I tried it and every time I was hopeful it would someday, I was always let down. And now with the extreme and pathetic ""solution"" the staff have come up with for their child pornography problem (which I am glad that they finally have become aware of that), they purged all nsfw content and any potentially nsfw tag has been blocked. Is this a joke? This app is rated 17+ and I, as a legal adult of 19 should be allowed to view the nsfw content. Safe search was an option for anyone who was not interested and blacklisting certain tags was also available, which I appreciated and made sure to use. Now many blogs that had nothing to do with the problem have been removed while phishing porn bots continue at large. Censoring legal content accomplishes nothing except losing many users. I am only considering staying for friends that have been lucky not to be purged and although I have lost any hope for tumblr at this point, maybe the staff will listen to its users after seeing their ratings take a dive.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"November 27, 2018"

7067,A Google user,"I've been using tumblr for about 7 years now, and the vast majority of that time has been from the app. Using it has ranged from frustrating to unusable. Staff has never been transparent in communications and only 1/5 of updates are actually helpful and needed. The blocking system doesn't work and hasn't for years, the tagging system is still broken after staff broke it, the trending page is controlled by staff and has been for years to keep political things off and now with their most recent change it seems staff is trying to see how quickly they can destroy their own platform. I dont think I'll continue to use tumblr after the 17th. This isnt just about the nsfw ban but the buildup leading to this. The taking down of BLM and Ferguson from trending tags, the unfair treatment of LGBT people by the censors, the horrific coding of the app, the astounding number of bugs in the app, and now with them burning half the site down to kill a spider, I dont think I can stay. I will list the changes I did like. Adding an official way to blacklist tags, messaging, the trending page in theory is fine, i like the 'most popular posts' at the top of blogs, and the app did get more stable as time went on. But these are small fixes. Repainting the door wont help if half the house is still in ashes.

7410,A Google user,"Tumblr used to be my fav app, not only for traditional nsfw content but also for art that includes mature themes. The recent decision by tumblr executives has left me saddened, Tumblr is a place of free expression of the human experience and a large part of that experience is erotic in nature. To blindly assume that removing this vital part of the app will somehow make it better is shortsighted and naive. I love Tumblr and i don't want to leave it but if this decision isn't reversed then i will be left with no other choice. My word of advice to you tumblr is to listen to your users and make the decision that benefits all of us, even a compromise would be better than this all or nothing philosophy. I suggest finding a better solution such as a toggle for users that don't want to see nsfw content or ""female-presenting nipples"" as you so eloquently put it.

I am very disappointed by all this, not even because it was the last big platform that allowed adult content, but also because this undermines a lot of people, especially artists. A lot of people rely on Tumblr to connect with their audiences and they are going to end up banned and removed. This is unacceptable. Instead of dealing with the problematic bits, you uproot the entire tree. You're going to put a lot of people out of work if you go through with this policy and in return are going to kill off your own platform because you will be killing one of it's main appeals. There's only two ways - either you abolish the policy and search for other options or you go through with it and everyone will suffer.

Tumblr completely disregard any of their existing user base's needs or wishes and fumble blindly as they try to keep their own place ""safe"" and ""tidy"".
