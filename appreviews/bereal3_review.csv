Also, the BeReal that was for that date moved itself to the date of Mar. 31. I've been doing a BeReal each day since that date, but nothing shows up in my memories. Edit: For those who have the same problem, I just figured it out. Just uninstall and reinstall the app. Your BeReals will still be saved, and it will go back to normal.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,15 people found this review helpful,"March 23, 2023"

It has very little opportinity for scrolling (if they add scrolling/shorts/mini videos, I will delete it so fast I swear). It is a cute way to really see and reflect on a moment in a day and how you spend most of your time.

2,Harlie C.,"In response to the developer: It would seem this is not the case for any of my friends. After they hit the shutter button, they are able to see and pose for both the front and back camera rather than for just one. My friends all have iphones, but I have android, so I assume this is an android glitch. Not so good on android. Takes both pictures at once so you can't actually see one of the pictures until it's already taken.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,29 people found this review helpful,"March 18, 2023"

6,Aberly Price,I love this app! The concept is great and it's hard to get addicted like other social media apps. The one critique I have is that if there is no way to log in. I recently got a new phone and still can't log into my account on it. If I want to take a bereal I have to take both phones with me. This I a huge annoyance. Pls add a log in button for those with a new phone.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,176 people found this review helpful,"February 8, 2023"
7,BananaTDM,I got this app because all my friends had it and I or to see my friend's face for the first time in 4 years. Its a great way to connect with those who are distant and close. You get to meet new people who you have mutual friends with or meet people who you don't know. You can only post one visible picture per day and can only repost once which is unique. You can download your posts and see who screenshotted them. You can also go back and see what you have posted in the past. Overall a great app!,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20 people found this review helpful,"March 13, 2023"
8,JD Perez,"It's a fun and interesting app, but memories have some kind of glitch where a ton of my memories get hidden at a time, then randomly reappear another time when other memories suddenly become gone.

10,Sabs,"The overall idea of the app is great. The picture quality is nice, it's a fun app. However, there are a couple of bugs that, no matter what I do, just won't be fixed. For one, whenever I try to upload a late be real, it doesn't actually upload. It always says in red text ""upload failed. Click to retry."" And then when I click it, it loads for like, a second, and then immediately goes back to ""upload failed. Click to retry."" It won't even let me delete it and make a new one.

Would be five stars, but there is a persistent bug that does not allow me to turn off notifications for late BeReals (notification saying ""friend just posted a little late"").

18,Julianna,I give it a 4 star review because the overall app is very good but the only thing is that whenever you try to take a photo it will only show you one side of taking it. For example if you want to start your picture in selfie mode than you can see yourself and then take the pic but then when it switches to the forward camera I can't see the picture and you have to kind of just guess what the picture will look like om the forward camera and hope for the best.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,23 people found this review helpful,"December 5, 2022"
19,Miche Ellington,"So fun but the app for android renders it mostly unusable. My posts rarely save or update, when they do they double post.

You cannot add any friends, at least not using the Samsung Galaxy 20FE on whatever the latest Android version is. When you create an account, you might be able to add a few (if the ones in your contacts are listed, but half aren't) but on the normal add friends screen, if you click on the add button, it just blinks and does nothing.

I'll be able to see other people's BeReal's for a second and then it'll get blurred again. I try refreshing, redoing the photos, but some days I just can't post.

Curious tho, it originally had a great unique notification sound that was easily recognised, but now it seems to have changed itself to other sounds that are already in use, so I don't recognise it any more. I definitely didn't change it, as there's nowhere in the app details to change the sounds.

Although this app is a great non-annoying alternate to Snapchat but it needs to add a lot more features, some of them could be :- 1) BeRaw and BeCreative where people post raw selfies vs creative, wierd looking, with filter photos. 2) a letter feature (long messages sending option) alternative to chat feature in most social media apps.

For a SM platform which has leaned into being realistic/minimalistic as much as you have, the one feature you DO have shouldn't be this buggy. This better be fixed ASAP.

However I think it's really cool because you have more interaction with your friends, especially with the customized emojis and the way everyone around you has to post a BeReal at the same time as everyone else.

I find it hard to add friends because not all my contacts are synced and I've tried various methods of changing the contacts access but see less than 5% of my contacts who should be there to actually find them. Edit: Thanks for your reply. I am definitive I have their right number saved and my friends have been able to find the friends using the same number.

I love how whenever you get a BeReal, it's at a completely random time in the day. It could be now, it could be in an hour, nobody knows! Having this randomness gives the app it's humanity, with every photo you see, you know that it just happened! Sure, it might get a little boring to use after a while, but that's it's whole point!

I do however dislike the fact that the time you posted is recorded as the time the photo uploads rather than the time you took it. Occasionally, when I post, it can take over an hour for the photo to actually finish uploading, making it marked as late. Instead, I think the time should be recorded as when you took the photo.

1564,Medina Halouane,"Fun concept but the app seems to be flawed. It takes ages to upload what I am doing and sometimes it makes me retake them hours later which can be really frustrating. Not only that, but my memories are not recorded and do not allow me to see what I have posted in past days as though I hadn't posted anything even though I had.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"May 3, 2022"
1565,Kateřina Černá,"The app itself is amazing, but there are bugs - I cannot add friends. I click the button, it loads for a while and does nothing. I can click it 500 times and still nothing happens. I thought that it's because I had old phone, but I got a new one now and the bug is still there.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"August 29, 2022"
1566,Cécile Ranzoni,"Very original idea. However, I can't add friends. When I press ""add"" next to my friends names, nothing happens. This makes the experience quite pointless. I really hope this gets fixed as I would love to use the app fully.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"September 28, 2022"
1567,Kaitlyn Roberts,Its an interesting concept and I liked the app but the past few days it has been glitching for me. I would post when it says to but then I couldn't see any of my friends post and after a few hours I'd check and I'd have to post a new post because it would delete mine. Today I haven't been able to post period. It would go up for 2 seconds then dissappear. I like the app but I'm not gonna use it if this keeps up.,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"May 1, 2022"
1568,Eric Fischer,"I _was_ enjoying this app - slightly rough around the edges, but still cool. Pictures stopped loading today so I attempted to reinstall and holy crow is that flow painful. Slow SMS messages, nonresponsive app, once it even locked up my whole device. Unable to finish install/signup, so I guess I just don't have the app now. Might try again next week, but for now I'm kinda just sad I can't keep doing this with my physically distant friends.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"June 23, 2022"
1569,Paige,Love the concept of this app but the execution on Android is awful. There's no way to see who you've already requested to add as a friend or accept friend requests from other people. Which is kind of makes the app pointless if you can't add friends ... You can tell all the development went toward iOS and this was just a sad afterthought. I will probably be uninstalling soon if the major bugs aren't fixed for Android,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,4 people found this review helpful,"September 9, 2022"
1570,Brad,"There is an issue with me uploading reals. It will post then basically tell me I need to redo the proccess, and I will be stuck in the loop, unable to actually get my daily post in. Methods I used to troubleshoot: going onto data, going onto wifi, turning off data or wifi respectively, deleting and reinstalling the app.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"May 1, 2022"
1571,Christopher A,"It's so buggy. I think i experience a different bug each bereal. The main bugs are getting the notification and clicking, and then having nothing show up, or having yesterday's bereal be posted under today's. It makes no sense. It's so buggy for something that should be so simple.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"September 23, 2022"
1572,Erin Sovereign,"I like it but there's some things that were never added or fixed on the android version that work fine on iOS. Like adding a friend or accepting a pending friend request. Every time I select adding a friend, it doesn't do anything. And someone friend requested me a while ago but it never showed up.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"September 8, 2022"
1573,michael maga,I love the idea of this app so much but I wish it ran a bit better. One of the biggest asks is that I wish that your friends real reacts were saved in line with your photo. I find myself screenshotting my realmojis almost every day. Just available to the user. It would be a great update to add this to the app natively.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,6 people found this review helpful,"August 17, 2022"
1574,Aidan D,"App just doesn't work. Couldn't accept a friend request so uninstalled the app and reinstalled, then couldn't see the picture I'd posted earlier that day and was prompted to upload a new one - couldn't see any of my friends pictures until I did. Also tried to upload a profile photo and nothing happens when I choose a picture.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,6 people found this review helpful,"April 23, 2022"
1575,Claire Schmitz,"Same buggy issues as many before it seems, on Samsung S21. I take a pic within my time and share but it then continuously buffers trying to post it. I tried to add friends but the button just seems to be tapped and doesn't actually do the action. I've trouble-shooted all I can at this point.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,7 people found this review helpful,"August 30, 2022"
1576,Alejandra Indriago,"It's an app with potential to be great, it's pretty cool but i recommend putting less hours between bereals or that maybe can be editable. It becomes boring waiting that long but it's still a nice concept for keep knowing about your friends while separated.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"July 12, 2021"
1577,Nicolaas Swart,Great idea! But all my contacts that have Be real aren't being shown so I can't add them. They appeared once but then disappeared. It's also pretty difficult to search for someone if you don't know every single character of their username,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"July 10, 2022"
1578,OutFall,"Its a fun app. Love the concept. There are a few issues that need to be fixed. For instance, I got a friend request and tried to accept it but it wont let me. I can still see their post, but it keeps showing that i havent accepted their request. Overall it is really a great app.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"July 15, 2022"
1579,Patrick an Jamie,"I'd rather be able to take a photo of what I'm doing rather than an automatic photo. this is difficult because I am often working on confidential items on my computer that cannot be photographed so this makes the app less usable for me. However if I had more of a pause between photos, I could ensure what is visible on what I'm doing isn't breaching confidentiality. since I can't I can only show me and my dog, and not what I'm doing, which is supposed to be the whole point.",Rated 1 stars out of five stars,1 person found this review helpful,"June 21, 2022"
