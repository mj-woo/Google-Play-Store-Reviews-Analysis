Also, the BeReal that was for that date moved itself to the date of Mar. 31. I've been doing a BeReal each day since that date, but nothing shows up in my memories. Edit: For those who have the same problem, I just figured it out. Just uninstall and reinstall the app. Your BeReals will still be saved, and it will go back to normal.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"March 23, 2023"
1,Carli Rudder,"I adore this app because of the one time a day and the photo calendar function. It has very little opportinity for scrolling (if they add scrolling/shorts/mini videos, I will delete it so fast I swear). It is a cute way to really see and reflect on a moment in a day and how you spend most of your time. Thanks for being unique among mainstream media, bereal.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"February 20, 2023"
2,Harlie C.,"In response to the developer: It would seem this is not the case for any of my friends. After they hit the shutter button, they are able to see and pose for both the front and back camera rather than for just one. My friends all have iphones, but I have android, so I assume this is an android glitch. Not so good on android. Takes both pictures at once so you can't actually see one of the pictures until it's already taken.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"March 18, 2023"

6,Aberly Price,I love this app! The concept is great and it's hard to get addicted like other social media apps. The one critique I have is that if there is no way to log in. I recently got a new phone and still can't log into my account on it. If I want to take a bereal I have to take both phones with me. This I a huge annoyance. Pls add a log in button for those with a new phone.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"February 8, 2023"
7,BananaTDM,I got this app because all my friends had it and I or to see my friend's face for the first time in 4 years. Its a great way to connect with those who are distant and close. You get to meet new people who you have mutual friends with or meet people who you don't know. You can only post one visible picture per day and can only repost once which is unique. You can download your posts and see who screenshotted them. You can also go back and see what you have posted in the past. Overall a great app!,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"March 13, 2023"
8,JD Perez,"It's a fun and interesting app, but memories have some kind of glitch where a ton of my memories get hidden at a time, then randomly reappear another time when other memories suddenly become gone. Also, you should be able to see captions and comments from past bereals, and being able to pin or favorite people would be a nice quality change.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"March 11, 2023"
9,Rainbow Shoodi,I love this app sm! I can connect with friends! I love itttt :) But lately there's been a few bugs like it crashing when I'm scrolling through suggested friends and things like that. I hope you can patch these bugs soon!

10,Sabs,"The overall idea of the app is great. The picture quality is nice, it's a fun app. However, there are a couple of bugs that, no matter what I do, just won't be fixed. For one, whenever I try to upload a late be real, it doesn't actually upload. It always says in red text ""upload failed. Click to retry."" And then when I click it, it loads for like, a second, and then immediately goes back to ""upload failed. Click to retry."" It won't even let me delete it and make a new one. Please fix this",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"November 9, 2022"
11,Rachel Osmond,"Fun app and I like the idea. Android version has lots of bugs still, like one of my friends still appears in the suggested friends list. Today I am unable to react to or comment on anyone's pictures. In the past it took several min to upload a picture but with the new android update that appears to be resolved. Bugs are annoying but I still enjoy the app.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"November 10, 2022"

14,Elliot Earles,"Very much like the concept and execution of taking the photos, as well as the limited interactions of reactions and comments. Everything else is extremely frustrating though. I try to turn off notifications every single day because I don't need to know when my friend uploads or when someone comments, and every single day it turns them back on. There needs to be a lot more motivation to upload photos on time, because right now there is no real reason to try.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"November 16, 2022"
15,Ian Boenisch-Oakes,"Cool app, but bugs! Would be five stars, but there is a persistent bug that does not allow me to turn off notifications for late BeReals (notification saying ""friend just posted a little late""). The toggle appears to save in settings, but it always reverts back when closing the app. Very frustrating! If this is fixed, 5 stars!",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"November 16, 2022"
16,Cricket,"Great app! Awesome idea to see what people are up to especially your friends lol. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because I lost my ""time to take a Bereal!""

17,Fam Salinas,"Everything is good, but the notifications seem to reset often for no reason. I have many friends on this app who post late BeReals, and it's annoying to always have notifications from the app. whenever i try to turn them off, they turn back on, which is very annoying. if there is some way to fix this, that'd be great",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"November 26, 2022"
18,Julianna,I give it a 4 star review because the overall app is very good but the only thing is that whenever you try to take a photo it will only show you one side of taking it. For example if you want to start your picture in selfie mode than you can see yourself and then take the pic but then when it switches to the forward camera I can't see the picture and you have to kind of just guess what the picture will look like om the forward camera and hope for the best.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"December 5, 2022"
19,Miche Ellington,"So fun but the app for android renders it mostly unusable. My posts rarely save or update, when they do they double post. Most pressing is the way that the app logs me out at random and the only way to get back into my account is to uninstall the whole thing and re-download it. Cool concept and would love to try again with it once it uhhh works.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"October 31, 2022"
20,Felix Schroeder,"Amazing app with great idea!! However there is definitely notification spam. Whenever any friend posts it will notify your phone and this is really annoying. You can turn it off in the settings but after about 12 hours it turns itself back on. I DONT CARE IF SOMEONE POSTED A LATE. Please fix your notification software!!!

21,Caroline Lee,"I love using the app and the idea is great. However, my 2022 recap won't download. It just stayed loading. To try to fix it I uninstalled bereal and reinstalled only to receive a ""sorry come back later"" message when trying to login. I also can no longer see my location when posting bereals which has been a problem for several months now.

22,Ted Gideonse,"It seems like a good idea but the failure of the Android app is pretty colossal. You cannot add any friends, at least not using the Samsung Galaxy 20FE on whatever the latest Android version is. When you create an account, you might be able to add a few (if the ones in your contacts are listed, but half aren't) but on the normal add friends screen, if you click on the add button, it just blinks and does nothing. If tried uninstalling and reinstalling and so on, but nothing.",Rated 2 stars out of five stars,"October 9, 2022"
23,Emily H,"Love the idea and love it when it works. But it frequently does not upload, even when I wait for the bar to finish loading. I'll be able to see other people's BeReal's for a second and then it'll get blurred again. I try refreshing, redoing the photos, but some days I just can't post. Frustrating to say the least, and it's gotten worse the past month or so. Will stop using if it doesn't get fixed soon",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"October 10, 2022"
24,Jenny Joyce,"I'm loving this fun app. Especially now I've figured out I can slightly move the camera on the second shot to get a better angle on the pic! Curious tho, it originally had a great unique notification sound that was easily recognised, but now it seems to have changed itself to other sounds that are already in use, so I don't recognise it any more. I definitely didn't change it, as there's nowhere in the app details to change the sounds. I'd love the original back 🙂",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"March 18, 2023"
25,Himanshi JEE,"I absolutely adore this app. But I think, to maintain its hype the app really needs to do a lot more work. The app hasn't reached its full potential yet. Although this app is a great non-annoying alternate to Snapchat but it needs to add a lot more features, some of them could be :- 1) BeRaw and BeCreative where people post raw selfies vs creative, wierd looking, with filter photos. 2) a letter feature (long messages sending option) alternative to chat feature in most social media apps.

26,Matt Roberts,"I want to use it both as a way of keeping in touch with friends and as sort of daily diary, but it's lacking some features for the later. My two requests are 1) save the photos to a directory on the phone so I can automatically sync them with Google photos and 2) save the captions and comments so they're there when I look back in ""memories"" so I can have some context with the photos.",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"March 11, 2023"
27,Binxu748er,"Creative idea, yet I have no clue what its full potential can offer. Finding friends is not easy, since contacts are not really being synced or properly searched up.

I like the app, but retrieving contacts should be improved.",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"March 5, 2023"
28,Luca De Jong,"The idea of the app is great! It's amazing to have a filterless platform and get a glimpse of the life of one's friends. However, for such a popular app, it's really bad on technical issues. Captions I post disappear, new BeReals from others won't load for hours, I get a notification that it's time to BeReal and then you aren't even able to take a BeReal picture until after some time.

Even worse, I found out that I'm not the only one experiencing this bug. For a SM platform which has leaned into being realistic/minimalistic as much as you have, the one feature you DO have shouldn't be this buggy. This better be fixed ASAP.

30,Random 69,"Well it's pretty boring as a social media, because you can only see your friends and what they're doing, so you can't find the exact content you're looking for like reddit or instagram. However I think it's really cool because you have more interaction with your friends, especially with the customized emojis and the way everyone around you has to post a BeReal at the same time as everyone else. It's a cool concept, and an enjoyable one, as you'll mostly see the humbler side of your friends.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"March 14, 2023"
31,Bhavesh Kharbanda,The app and idea is amazing. I find it hard to add friends because not all my contacts are synced and I've tried various methods of changing the contacts access but see less than 5% of my contacts who should be there to actually find them. Edit: Thanks for your reply. I am definitive I have their right number saved and my friends have been able to find the friends using the same number. The app detects few contacts at a time and sometimes one/two of them show up who had joined a long time ago.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"January 9, 2023"
32,Rosi Hirst,"A good concept but in reality it rarely works how it should. The whole app revolves around receiving a notification at a random time of the day but it rarely works, 2 out of 3 times no notification arrives at all.

33,Jose Otavio Carlomagno Filho,"I really like the concept and the app works fine for me, but I think it's just too easy to choose the time of the day you actually post and that completely defeats the point of it.

36,Syssinad,"I'm going to BeReal for a minute and say that this is probably the best social media app that I have experienced. I love how whenever you get a BeReal, it's at a completely random time in the day. It could be now, it could be in an hour, nobody knows! Having this randomness gives the app it's humanity, with every photo you see, you know that it just happened! Sure, it might get a little boring to use after a while, but that's it's whole point! It's trying to tell us a message about social media.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"January 29, 2023"
37,Nicholas Tsinwntas,"Edit: still great but I had to drop a star because of the randomness of the moments in the day it can push for a photo. I want the devs, please, to allow us for windows of time. For example I don't want it to prompt me after 10pm but I am willing for 9am. I think this is a very simple feature and if the devs implement it, I'll give it back its fifth star. great for far away friends to keep tabs on eachother",Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"January 26, 2023"
38,Zoë Holman,The dual selfie and back camera.. I get the idea but it leads to mine and most of my friends photos being blurry so it kind of ruins the experience a bit.

Bring that back and it's perfect!!,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"January 13, 2023"
39,Misty Stephens,"I use this as a daily check in with my closest family and friends. It's so fun and such a simple concept. It's sort of the opposite of Instagram. once a day it asks you to be real. you snap a pic, can't filter/crop/alter. You only see your friends daily posts once you post. and they disappear in 24 hours. The camera takes a pic from both front and back.",Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"March 27, 2023"

44,ceez,Really like how simple and REAL it is. Could use some features like taking pictures of your reactions in your settings instead of doing it through other people's uploads.

It was soo annoying!. But putting that aside its a good app and I like it so ill give it a 3 🌟 considering the depleting issue. I think that you should be allowed to delete your be real more then 2 times. You should be able to delete it aleast 5 times because I mess up ALOT.

227,Allie Greene,This app is great and really fun to use. My only complaint is that if you mess up on a BeReal you can only delete so many until it won't let you delete anymore. But other than that I really like this app.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,"March 14, 2023"
228,Delith Edstrom,"I love this app as it helps to be in touch with my family and friends but it's soooo frustrating.

229,Ally,Purchased a new phone and can't login to established account - the only option is creating a new account. there is also a bug as I am stuck in a loop of entering username and birthdate. Bereal only responded after a poor review. I manage app based tech support. After basic troubleshooting & reading forums describing this issue I did reach out with more info. But got no response. The product team should be able to reproduce this to solve. Just add it to the tech debt and count me as churned. ✌️,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,"January 3, 2023"
230,Benjamin Babineau,I've just started to use the app. Sorta confusing at first as well as learning how to actually connect with new people that are not on your contact list. It's actually a pretty basic app so far. Not a lot of ways to chat with people or any other ways to personalize your experience. I'll keep it installed for a few to test it out better.,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"December 5, 2022"

I am giving 4 stars because the photos taken through the app are not good enough compared to my friends that are using iPhones. I am with Pixel 7 Pro which has great cameras but I guess BeReal is not using or take full advantage of the camera2 APIs as even a third party camera app - Facebook and Instagram are taking better pictures through their Android apps so it comes down to optimizations and investments.,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,"January 4, 2023"

It sends them the friend request, and if you never end up being friends with them is because they don't wanna accept your friend request, I feel like some of y'all really have a peanut brain.

When I'm looking at the feed from the camera before I take a shot, I look fine, but once I've taken the photo the rendering of the image looks alot different, I look grey and tired. Big sad. Might be good to have an option where you can use flash on the front facing but not the back facing camera? Or change how the photo is rendered or something to make me look less ghastly?",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"November 27, 2022"

I do however dislike the fact that the time you posted is recorded as the time the photo uploads rather than the time you took it.

Needs a lot of work tho, im not able to add any friends or search them etc. Also maybe add some more features cuz the app feels kinda dry. Its a good approach to maybe make people use social media less but itd be fun with more ways to engage. Maybe some video features or my discovery is more relevant to my location.

Adding friends doesn't work properly, adding an Instant Realmoji sometimes just breaks off, etc... I don't like the idea if you don't take a picture at that exact moment, you'll post ""late"", as the name of the photo itself says.

1603,Maria Blackmore,This app is pretty neat but its glitchy. A lot of times I'll post a new be real and it'll still show the one from the previous day or one of the pictures will update but the other one from the front camera will still be from the previous day.

But in reality, it just leverages some of the *other* problems with social media. Its entire premise is that it randomly interrupts your day to tell you to engage with social media... no thanks.

1694,Morteza Esmaeilnezhad,It's a good idea but poorly executed. The main issue is that the app tells you when you can post something and you only have 2 minutes. A better solution in my opinion is to let users choose from 4 -5 different period of time to get notified and have 5 minute time to capture and post. This way users can choose a time period out of their working hours.

It does not feel me with any joy what so ever when my notification goes off at 11pm bc im set to the east asia timezone when i dont even live in asia. Doing todays be real tomorrow bc im asleep is my least favourite thing ever. Thank you. - Kayla and Georgie",Rated 3 stars out of five stars,"October 14, 2022"
